When we talk to founders about good and bad investors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say \"he writes checks.\" That doesn't mean the investor says yes to everyone. It means he makes up his mind quickly, and follows through.\n",

The most important reason for having surprisingly good customer service is that it helps you understand your users.

If they limited themselves to saying that it made them feel bad when one person had so much more money than other people, who would disagree? It makes me feel bad too, and I think people who make a lot of money have a moral obligation to use it for the common good. The mistake they make is to jump from feeling bad that some people are much richer than others to the conclusion that there's no legitimate way to make a very large amount of money.\n",
