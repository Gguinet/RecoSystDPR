   Fashionable Problems
   December 2019
   I've seen the same pattern in many different fields: even
   though lots of people have worked hard in the field, only a
   small fraction of the space of possibilities has been explored,
   because they've all worked on similar things.
   Even the smartest, most imaginative people are surprisingly
   conservative when deciding what to work on. People who would
   never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked
   into working on fashionable problems.
   If you want to try working on unfashionable problems, one of
   the best places to look is in fields that people think have
   already been fully explored: essays, Lisp, venture funding you
   may notice a pattern here. If you can find a new approach into
   a big but apparently played out field, the value of whatever
   you discover will be [3]multiplied by its enormous surface
   area.
   The best protection against getting drawn into working on the
   same things as everyone else may be to [4]genuinely love what
   you're doing. Then you'll continue to work on it even if you
   make the same mistake as other people and think that it's too
   marginal to matter.
