   Coronavirus and Credibility
   April 2020
   I recently saw a [3]video of TV journalists and politicians
   confidently saying that the coronavirus would be no worse than
   the flu. What struck me about it was not just how mistaken they
   seemed, but how daring. How could they feel safe saying such
   things?
   The answer, I realized, is that they didn't think they could
   get caught. They didn't realize there was any danger in making
   false predictions. These people constantly make false
   predictions, and get away with it, because the things they make
   predictions about either have mushy enough outcomes that they
   can bluster their way out of trouble, or happen so far in the
   future that few remember what they said.
   An epidemic is different. It falsifies your predictions rapidly
   and unequivocally.
   But epidemics are rare enough that these people clearly didn't
   realize this was even a possibility. Instead they just
   continued to use their ordinary m.o., which, as the epidemic
   has made clear, is to talk confidently about things they don't
   understand.
   An event like this is thus a uniquely powerful way of taking
   people's measure. As Warren Buffett said, "It's only when the
   tide goes out that you learn who's been swimming naked." And
   the tide has just gone out like never before.
   Now that we've seen the results, let's remember what we saw,
   because this is the most accurate test of credibility we're
   ever likely to have. I hope.
